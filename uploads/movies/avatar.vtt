1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Your whole body.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.580
Your whole body!

3
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.459
What was the first incident with Trump?

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.679
What was that?

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.179
Who's killing you?

6
00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.140
Okay.

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.620
Well, it's just a homework,

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.699
you've done a stupid thing and that's all.

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.980
But listen toâ€¦.

10
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.480
While I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for.

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.480
Ladies and gentlemen, you are not in Kansas anymore.

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
You are on Pandora.

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.480
You should see your faces.

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.980
We have an indigenous population called the Navi.

15
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.980
They are very hard to kill.

16
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.980
This is why we're here.

17
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

18
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.480
Their village happens to be resting on the richest deposit

19
00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.979
and they need to relocate.

20
00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.979
Those savages are threatening our whole operation.

21
00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.479
We're on the brink of war and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

22
00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.979
The concept is to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatarsin.

23
00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.479
They grown from human DNA mixed with DNA of the natives.

24
00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.479
Marine in an avatar body, that's a potent mix.

25
00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.979
You get me what I need. I'll see to it you get your legs bent.

26
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.980
Your real legs.

27
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.480
Helly A, sir. Looks like you.

28
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.480
This is your avatars.

29
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

30
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.480
It shouldn't be hard for you.

31
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.480
Jake, it's real simple.

32
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.980
I want you to learn from the inside. I want you to get in your trust.

33
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.980
You have not been here.

34
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.980
Go back.

35
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.980
This is your fault.

36
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.980
I need your help.

37
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.980
Outstanding.

38
00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.979
Out of that lost in the woods, Harry.

39
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.979
Don't forget what team you're playing for.

40
00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.979
Strong prey on the weak. Nobody does anything.

41
00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.979
You've got one hour.

42
00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.979
You knew this would happen?

43
00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:37.979
Everything changed.

44
00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.979
Jake, it's crazy here.

45
00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
The poor rich is rolling and there's no stopping him.

46
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.979
We're going up against gunships.

47
00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.979
There's bows and arrows.

48
00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.979
I guess we better stop here.

49
00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:53.439
The

50
00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:08.479
They've sent us a message that they can take whatever they want.

51
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.479
But we will send them a message.

52
00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.479
That this...

53
00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.479
This is all the land.
