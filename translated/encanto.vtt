00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Many years ago, this candle blessed our family with a miracle.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Our house, our casita came to life with magic.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
La casita.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Fours, trours.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The cows.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In time, every member of our family was given their own magical gift.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I understand you.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm not super strong like Luisa.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The donkey's gone out again.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Ony.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Or effortlessly perfect like Senyoni's perfecta is a bellug.

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But mama, why am I the only one that didn't get a gift?

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You're just as special as anyone else in this family.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You just healed my hand with the nade pa con queso.

15
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Casita.

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What's going on?

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The magic is in danger.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We gotta get out of here!

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We must protect our home. We must protect our family.

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is my chance. I will save the magic.

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Wait. How do I save the magic?

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm losing my gift.

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm in a room now.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You have it. The fate of the family is gonna come down to you.

25
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I can't do this.

26
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Let me help you. The rats told me everything. Don't eat those.

27
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Even in our darkest moments, there's light.

28
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Are you beast expected?

29
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
A lot of stairs.

30
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But at least I'll have a friend.

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Nope. We flew away immediately.

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Quitter!
