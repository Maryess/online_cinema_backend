00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.759
In this way, Slur. I am the one who runs for both the living and the dead. A man who

2
00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.759
reduced to a single instinct.

3
00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:19.759
Survive.

4
00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.759
It is by my hand.

5
00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:38.759
You arise from the ashes of this world.

6
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:45.759
We are not things. We are not things.

7
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.759
Where is he taking them?

8
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:03.759
I want them back. They're my property.

9
00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.759
I want a day. What a lovely day.

10
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.760
Want to get through this?

11
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.760
Let's go!

12
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.760
Go!

13
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.760
As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken.

14
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.760
It was hard to know who was more crazy.

15
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Me or everyone else.
